## Website Link:

https://unstoppabledomains.com/



## What I find interesting about this website:



 I find unstoppable domains to be interesting because they are leading the move towards Web3. Instead of the traditional ".com" and  ".edu" domains, they are moving towards domains like ".crypto", ".x", ".coin", etc. These are interesting due to the fact that these domains are only a one time purchase and live on the Ethereum blockchain and are decentralized. \  

 This will allow the internet to go back to its roots of activism and free speach, as people will not be able to easily censor these blockchain websites. While some people may say that this is dangerous, it is infact going back to what the internet was intially intented to be used for. Free speech and the ability to voice ones opinion without the fear of being censored. \
